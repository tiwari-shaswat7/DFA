# Deterministic Finite State Automata

### Micro Project for the partial fulfillment for Theory of Computation to be submitted to Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, IOE Pulchowk Campus.

Write a program to implement Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) using any programming language. The transition function and other components of the DFA should be configurable using a text file in some format. The user input would be the string input to the DFA. The program should show each configuration (q,w) step by step till the entire string input is read. Finally the DFA should accept or reject the input string.

Submit the source code, executable/binary, screenshot of the program output and a readme file showing how to use your program and configure the DFA.
